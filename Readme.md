# Vue.js + Firebase Authentication

This project was about how to use Firebase Authentication in my Vue.js application and allow users to authenticate with third-party providers (Twitter, GitHub, Google etc.) or plain old email and password. Whats more no server-side code was necessary.

What I learned creating the application:

- How to set up and connect to Firebase Authentication.
- How to sign users up, in and out.
- How to catch Firebase auth errors.
- How to authenticate a user via 3rd party providers.
- How to update a Firebase userâ€™s profile, email, and password.
- How to link multiple authentication providers to one user account.
- How we can store additional user data in our backend.
- How to protect routes in a Single Page Application, using Vue Router, Vuex, and Firebase Authentication.
